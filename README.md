# Machine Learning - Hurricanes

This project space is for me to apply recently learned machine learning concepts to a topic that's interesting to me - tropical cyclones.

## Ramping Up

The `ramping_up` directory is a space for exploring data. The notebooks in this directory are:

1. IBTrACS - Load and explore IBTrACS data, a source of tropical cyclone tracking.
2. GOES - Load and explore GOES16 and GOES17 satellite imagery data stored on Amazon Web Services.
3. GOES and IBTrACS - Load both IBTrACS and GOES data, project both data into the same projection, and overlay the track data of a hurricane on a GOES16 image.
