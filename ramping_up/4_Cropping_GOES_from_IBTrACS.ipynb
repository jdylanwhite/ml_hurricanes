    "# Cropping GOES Imagery from IBTrACS\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we can properly project and cross-reference GOES data, let's try using the IBTrACS data to find where the storm is on an image and crop the image. We'll use the same example, Hurricane Harvey in 2017, to drive the example here again.\n",
    "\n",
    "In hindsight, I realize that this isn't very different from the previous notebook. I started this notebook because I need a way to identify if a point in latitude/longitude space in the IBTrACS data was actually on the visible full disc GOES image. I had started this complicated method where I convert every pixel in the GOES image into a meshed grid of latitudes/longitudes, find the closest latitude and logitude in the image to the IBTrACS latitude and longitude, and then use that to determine whether or not the IBTrACS point was on the image. But performing calculations and comparisons on 10000 by 10000 element arrays is quite cumbersom. Then I realized that I can do it the other way - convert the latitude/longitude to the GOES projection and then find its closest point in the much smaller 10000 by 1 $x$ and $y$ arrays stored in the GOES netCDF file. I think I'll still have to use the meshed grid to see if the closest point is on the disc, but this will now be a much shorter process, since I don't need to find the closest latitude and longitude on that large array.\n",
